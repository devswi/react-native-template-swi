# React Native Template

A minimal template with needed configurations.

1. Add `prettier` and `eslint` configuration
2. Add `husky` and `lint-staged` which I used every day
3. Add wonderful open source dependencies, such as
   - `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/native-stack` for navigating between screens.
   - `react-native-safe-area-context`
   - `react-native-gesture-handler` to handle user gesture
   - `react-native-reanimated`, this is an elegant animation libray in React Native
4. Move Gemfile into iOS folder
5. Update ruby version to `2.7.6` [Offical Ruby version](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/template/_ruby-version)
6. Buildin Typescript

## Usage
